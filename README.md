# Mobile Take Home Test

Here's a concise summary of the **process**, **code changes**, **test run-throughs**, and **future improvements** for your mobile test automation project using Appium and Java.

---

### üìù **Process Overview**
- **Cloned the repository** and set up **Appium** for both **iOS** and **Android**.
- Configured drivers with device-specific capabilities for iOS (via Xcode) and Android (via Android SDK).
- Implemented automation for app workflows (login, form submission, element validation) on both platforms.

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª **Code Changes**
- **Driver Setup**: Configured iOS and Android drivers with relevant capabilities:
  ```java
  // iOS capabilities
  iosCaps.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.PLATFORM_NAME, "iOS");
  // Android capabilities
  androidCaps.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.PLATFORM_NAME, "Android");
  ```

- **Element Interactions**: Implemented waits and actions:
  ```java
  WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
  MobileElement element = wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.id("element_id")));
  element.click();
  ```

- **Keyboard Handling**: Used `driver.hideKeyboard()` for iOS/Android to dismiss keyboards.

- **Screen Recording**: Integrated `ffmpeg` for iOS and Android screen recording to capture test execution.

---

### ‚è≥ **Future Improvements**
- **Enhance Test Coverage**: Add edge cases, error states, and additional app features.
- **Parallel Testing**: Run tests on multiple devices simultaneously using **Appium Grid** or cloud services.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate tests with **Jenkins** or **GitLab CI** on every commit.
- **Visual & Performance Testing**: Implement visual regression and performance metrics.

---

### üìã **Conclusion**
- The test automation suite is **functional** on both iOS and Android platforms.
- Future work includes **expanding test coverage**, **parallel execution**, and **CI/CD** integration for efficiency.
